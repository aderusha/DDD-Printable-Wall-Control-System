# DDD Printable Wall Control Quickhooks

Quickhooks are fast-printing, two part hook/hangar solutions designed for quick and easy printing for lightweight use cases. Quickhooks come in 3 variations based on strength (light/medium/heavy) and length (1/2/3").

## Printing notes

Quickhooks should be suitable for fast printing, set your slicer up for maximum perimeters to ensure a strong printed result.  The retainer is press fit into the quickhook body. I use a clamp to apply a steady force to press the retainer into place. A rubber mallet is another good way to press fit together a quickhook and a retainer.
