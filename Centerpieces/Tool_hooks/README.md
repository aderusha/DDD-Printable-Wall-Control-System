# DDD Printable Wall Control Centerpiece Tool Hooks

Centerpiece tool hooks designed for specific tool applications.

## Centerpiece Tool Hooks Naming

Centerpiece names start with the dimensions, roughly equivalent to inches as used on the Wall Control system.  A 2x4 Centerpiece is 2in in height and fits between sidepieces that are 4in apart.

  Holds 10x or 13x 10mm-wide screwdrivers (or similar).  I like [Wiha precision tools](https://amzn.to/2GQ8ucA) and these were designed to fit.  Combine with [2x2 L Brackets](../../Sidepieces/L_brackets/) and a [2x5 spacer](../../Centerpieces/Spacer_perforated/2x5%20Spacer%20perforated.stl).

  Holders for the [Wiha 33496 8-Piece T-Handle Hex Driver set](https://amzn.to/36gpuRK), split into two parts.  The [larger set](Wiha%20T-Handle%20M10%20M8%20M6%20M5.stl) needs to be set 3" away from the panel for the T-Handles to fit, so pair with [2x3 Angle Brackets](../../Sidepieces/Angle_brackets/) and a [2x4 spacer](../../Centerpieces/Spacer_perforated/2x4%20Spacer%20perforated.stl).  The [smaller set](Wiha%20T-Handle%20M4%20M3%20M2.5%20M2.stl) can set closer to the wall if desired, using [2x2 Angle Brackets](../../Sidepieces/Angle_brackets/) and a [2x3 spacer](../../Centerpieces/Spacer_perforated/2x3%20Spacer%20perforated.stl).

## Printing notes

In most use cases, the centerpieces are loaded with a bending moment, which is only really a problem when using the longer (4"+) models.  Adding perimeters and infill can help with rigidity, but for most cases simply printing fast and cheap should work fine.  PLA is a good choice for maximum rigidity.
